### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrei Mihai and I am currently a student as University of Transylvania Brasov, Computer Engineering.
I like challenges and I enjoy solving programming problems and as of late a little bit of hardware problems too.

Favorite subjects would be:
  - App Development
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Embedded Systems.
Out of the programming zone, I also enjoy
    -> interacting with other people
    -> playing team games as footbal or basketball with my friends
    -> going to the gym and lifting heavy/ not so heavy things
    -> Watching anime or playing games
